## Description
This repo contains an analysis of the Airbnb data in Boston, USA. This was an assignment given to me by Udacity for the Data Science Nanodegree program. As part of this assignment a link to a medium article discussing my findings has been created and will be found in the link below.

### Installations
This analysis was perfomed using Anaconda Notebooks and will not require any additonal installations.
